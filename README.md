# Project Happy Thoughts API

This weeks project for the back end sprint focused on creating our own API with mongoDB and connecting it to a previous project - project happy thoughts

## The problem

Getting the queries in order was a good learning exprience but did not take to long, the challenge was understanding the structure and handling when deploying the API. Had to do slight modifications to backend and frontend to make the queries line up as intended
